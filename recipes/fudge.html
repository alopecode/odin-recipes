        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is the best fudge recipe ever! It's my aunt's recipe, passed down through the family. <br>
            It's better than any fudge I've ever had at the Jersey shore and easy enough to whip up in 15 minutes or so.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 (7 ounce) jar marshmallow creme</li>
            <li>⅔ cup evaporated milk</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups milk chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped nuts</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

                and salt together in a large saucepan over medium heat; bring <br>

            <li>Remove from heat and add milk chocolate chips and semisweet <br>
                chocolate chips; stir until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. <br>
