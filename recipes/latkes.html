        <h3>Description of Recipe</h3>
        <p>Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must-have at Hanukkah, but are really wonderful <br>
            any time of the year! This is my mother's recipe, which is honestly the best potato <br>
            latke I've had. I usually end up making a second batch because they disappear so quickly. <br>
            I've tried other recipes and always return to this one. Lovely topped with sour cream or applesauce.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated onion</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Direction</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix potato, onion, eggs, crushed crackers, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture, first pressing potato mixture against <br>
                the side of the bowl to remove excess liquid, into the hot oil; slightly <br>
                flatten the latkes into the oil with the back of your spoon so they are an even thickness.</li>
            <li>Cook in batches in the hot oil until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain latkes on a paper towel-line plate.</li>
        </ol>
